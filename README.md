## Note

Current branch is based on VuePress@v2, and itâ€™s still in beta.

This means that features and API are not solid, and there might be BREAKING CHANGES in future releases.

Though the project has stable release of V1, and are held in [V1 Repo](https://github.com/vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope-v1/), but we do not recommend you to keep using V1 in new projects. See [V1 end of support Annoucement](https://github.com/vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope/discussions/1535) for more details.

## Details
