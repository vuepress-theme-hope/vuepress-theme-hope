See [Artalk Configuration](https://artalk.js.org/guide/frontend/config.html) for details.

The `el` `pageTitle`, `pageKey` and `site` options are reserved for plugins, they will be inferred from VuePress config.

Two function options `imgUploader` and `avatarURLBuilder` can only be set on client side.
