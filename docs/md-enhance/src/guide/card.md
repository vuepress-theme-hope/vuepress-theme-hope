## Usage

You can use card fence block to add a card into your markdown content. Both YAML and JSON format card data are supported:

````md
```card
# card data here
```

```card
{
  // card data here
}
```
````

Card data supports `title`, `desc`, `logo`, `link` and `color` properties.

If you want to place multiple cards together, you can wrap them in `card` container:

````md
::: card

```card
# card data here
```

```card
# card data here
```
