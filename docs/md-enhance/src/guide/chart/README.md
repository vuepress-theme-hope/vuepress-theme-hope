This plugin provides 6 ways to let you insert charts into your markdown file.

- Chart.js: A lightweight, easy-to-use, highly customizable chart library.

  Chart.js is lighter comparing to ECharts.

- ECharts: A powerful, interactive charting and visualization library for browser.

  ECharts is more powerful comparing to Chart.js.

- Flowchart: A simple markdown extension to generate flowcharts and sequence diagrams.

  Lightweight, only focusing on flowcharts.

- Markmap: Create mindmap with markdown

  The runtime is very heavy, not recommended.

- Mermaid: Generation of diagram and flowchart from text in a similar manner as markdown.

  Powerful collection of common charts.

- Plantuml: UML diagram driven by Java.

  No runtime.
