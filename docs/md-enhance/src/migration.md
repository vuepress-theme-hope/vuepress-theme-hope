## Legacy Mode

You can pass the second argument `true` to enable legacy mode when calling `mdEnhancePlugin`, and the plugin will try to run with V1 behavior.

## New Features

- `v-pre` support

  The following container support is removed, so `vPre` option is added

  ```md
  ::: v-pre

  Some {{vue syntax}}.

  :::
  ```

- Use `component` code block to add components easily

- Chart.js support

  Adds [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) support via `chart` option

  ````md
  ::: chartjs Title

  ```json
  {
    // chart.js config
  }
  ```

  :::

  ::: chartjs Title

  ```js
  const config = {
    // chart.js config
  };
  ```

  :::
  ````

- ECharts support

  Adds [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) support via `echarts` option

  ````md
  ::: echarts Title

  ```json
  {

  ```

  :::

  ::: echarts Title

- content include support

  Use `<!-- @include: -->` to include other file content in Markdown via `include` options.

  Use `<!-- @include: filename -->` to include a file.

  To partially import the file, you can specify the range of lines to be included:

  - `<!-- @include: filename{start-end} -->`
  - `<!-- @include: filename{start-} -->`
  - `<!-- @include: filename{-end} -->`

  Also, you can include file region:

  - `<!-- @include: filename#region -->`

  Add `markmap` container to create [Markmap](https://markmap.js.org/) via `markmap` option.

- Kotlin Playground

  Provide Kotlin playground via `kotlin-playground`
