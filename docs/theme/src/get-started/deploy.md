This tutorial guides you on how to deploy a VuePress project.

## Build Project

Once you completed the starter stage development of the project locally, you can build the website using the `pnpm docs:build` command.

If you are using theme template, the website content will be output to the `.vuepress/dist` under VuePress project folder These files are the final output of VuePress.

You can deploy the contents of this folder to your website's server. The easiest way to do this is to upload to GitHub and start GitHub Pages.

After the action finishes, you should go to GitHub repo settings to choose `gh-pages` as source of GitHub Pages.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

If you're using theme template, and you choose to create GitHub workflow during setup, the only thing you need to do is set the correct [base option](https://vuejs.press/reference/config.html#base).

- If you are going to publish to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/`, you must upload the entire project to the `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io` repository. You don't need to make any changes in this case, since base defaults to `"/"`.

- If your repository link is in a normal format like `https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>`, the website will be published to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io /<REPO>/`, so you need to set base to `"/<REPO>/"`.
