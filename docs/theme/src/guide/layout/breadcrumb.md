The theme adds Breadcrumb support, you can config it using `breadcrumb` in page frontmatter and theme options <Badge text="Support page config" /> [^supportpageconfig], the default value is `true`.

Without any config, a Breadcrumb that matches the theme color is displayed at the top of the page content to help the reader understand the document structure.

You can also control the icon display of the path navigation using `breadcrumbIcon` field <Badge text="Support page config" />, the default value is `true`.

::: warning Notice

To ensure Breadcrumb working well, the `README.md` file should be included in each folder.

Otherwise, the Breadcrumb will ignore that folder level because the component can not generate title and link.

Please remember to set a title for **HOME PAGE**!

:::

[^supportpageconfig]: **Page config support**

    **Support local configuration**<Badge text="Support page config" /> means that the theme allows the configuration of the page to override the global configuration.

    ::: details Example

    Take path navigation as an example:

    This feature is enabled globally by default, that is, `breadcrumb` in theme options is `true` by default, and you can set `breadcrumb: false` in the Front Matter of a specific page to disable it locally.

    Of course, you can also set the `breadcrumb: false` in theme options to disable it globally, and set `breadcrumb: true` in the Front Matter of a specific page to enable it locally.
