`vuepress-theme-hope` improves the default home page.

To use it, set `home: true` in page frontmatter. Any extra content after the `YAML front matter` will be parsed as normal Markdown and rendered after the features section.

## Site Information

You can use `heroText` to set the main title and `tagline` to set the subtitle.

If you have a logo, you can place it in the `public` folder and set it via `heroImage`, if you want to display another logo in night mode, you can use `heroImageDark`. For better A11y, we recommend that you set the description of Logo to `heroAlt`.

You can set the background image through `bgImage` and `bgImageDark`, but you need to pay attention that you must fill in the full URL or absolute path. If you want the information to be displayed in full screen, you can set `heroFullScreen: true`.

If you need to customize some styles, you can set the style of the logo and background image through `heroImageStyle` and `bgImageStyle`.
