## Usage

After enabling, this plugin will automatically add a copy button to the bottom right corner of each code block.

By default, the button is only displayed on desktop mode. To display this button on mobile devices, set `plugins.copyCode.showInMobile` to `true` in theme options.

After user press the copy button, a success hint will display on the screen. The default hint duration is `2000` ms, to change the duration, please set `plugins.copyCode.duration` in theme options. To disable the hint, set duration to `0`.

## Effect

```js
// .vuepress/config.js
import { hopeTheme } from "vuepress-theme-hope";

export default {
  theme: hopeTheme({
    plugins: {
      copyCode: {},
    },
  }),
};
```
