The theme displays last update time and contributors of the page via the [`@vuepress/plugin-git`][git] plugin, and provides support for an "edit this page" button.

The theme also provides navigation buttons for previous and next pages depending on sidebar config.

## Git-based Information

`vuepress-theme-hope` uses the built-in [`@vuepress/plugin-git`][git] plugin to automatically generate page create time, last update time and contributors.

The plugin will automatically generate the page creation time and last update time from the UNIX timestamp (ms) of `git` commit history of the page file, and generate contributors based on the commit record.

The theme will display last update time in the appropriate date format, along with all page contributors at the bottom of the page.

::: tip

The theme will use `Date.toLocaleString(pageLang)` to automatically localize the text of last update time according to the current language.

::: warning Limitations

1. Since the contributors, last update time, and file creation time information are based on `git`, you can only enable it in a `git` based project.
1. Since related information are from git commits, they will only be displayed after the first commit for a given page, and will only be updated when some commits change that page.

1. Since the `git` plugin needs to call Git binary and involves file IO, this function will seriously affect the startup and hot update speed, so by default **theme will not be enabled in devServer**. Set `plugins.git: true` or `hotReload: true` in theme options if needed.

## Edit Link

You can automatically generate edit links for each page by setting the following items in theme options:

- `docsRepo`: docs repository link, same as `repo` by default
- `docsDir`: the directory of docs in the repository, defaults to root directory
- `docsBranch`: docs branch, defaults to `"main"`

## Display Control

To hide these items globally, set the corresponding items below to `false` in theme options. You can also enable/disable specific pages by setting these items in `YAML front matter`:

- `lastUpdated`: whether to display last update time of the page
- `contributors`: whether to show page contributors
- `editLink`: whether to display "edit page" link
