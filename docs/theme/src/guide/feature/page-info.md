## Enable

Page information display is enabled globally by default, while supports page config. You can disable it by setting `pageInfo: false` in frontmatter of a specific page.

To keep it globally disabled, please set `pageInfo` to `false` in the plugin options. Then you can set `pageInfo` in frontmatter of a specific page to enable it locally.

## Parameters <Badge text="Support page config" />

`pageInfo` accepts an array of strings by default, filling in a group of items. The order of filling is the order in which the items are displayed.

The optional values and corresponding contents of the entry are as follows:

| Entry           | Corresponding content  | page frontmatter value             |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --- |
| `'Author'`      | author                 | author                             |
| `'Date'`        | Writing Date           | time                               |
| `'Original'`    | Whether is original    | isOriginal                         | N/A |
| `'Category'`    | Category               | category                           |
| `'Tag'`         | tags                   | tags                               |
| `'ReadingTime'` | Estimated reading time | N / A (automatically generated)    |
| `'Word'`        | Word count             | N / A (automatically generated)    |
| `'PageView'`    | Visits                 | visitor (only Valine is available) |

By default it will display "Author, Visit Number, Writing Date, Category, Tags, Expect Reading Time".

### author <Badge text="Support page config" />

Example:

```md
---
author: Mr.Hope
---
```

You can configure `author` in the plugin options to set the default author. And you can also configure `author` in frontmatter with a new value in the page to override the default author, or set it to `false` to cancel the author display.

Authors support `string[]`, `string`, `AuthorInfo` and `AuthorInfo[]`.

The format of AuthorInfo is as follows:

```ts
interface AuthorInfo {
  name: string;
  url?: string;
}
```

### Writing time

We recommended to fill it with a standard date format. A standard format is in the form of `xxxx-xx-xx`, such as "April 1, 2020" should be written as `2020-04-01`.

Example:

```md
---
date: 2020-01-01
---
```

### Category and Tags

See [blog section](../blog/category-and-tags.md) for details

### Reading time

The default statistic method is 300 words per minute. You can override it by setting `wordPerminute` in the plugin configuration. This option does not support individual configuration on the page.

### View Count <Badge text="Support page config" />

When using Waline as [Comment Service](comment.md), this function is enabled by default.

Example:

```md
---
visitor: false
---
```
