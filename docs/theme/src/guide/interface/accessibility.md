"A11y" stands for "accessibility".

The theme adds full support of accessibility.

- All page structures of the theme are processed semantically.

- All buttons and icons have their corresponding accessibility labels

- All main interactive elements can be focused and interacted through the keyboard

This is our support for the visually impaired people around the world! :heart:
