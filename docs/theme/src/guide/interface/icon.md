## Usage

We support multiple types of icons:

- `iconify` (default)
- `fontawesome`
- `iconfont`

Also, you can use images links with any icon types (relative links are NOT supported).

To specify icon assets, set `plugins.icon.assets` in theme options:

```js {7-21} title=".vuepress/config.js"
import { hopeTheme } from "vuepress-theme-hope";

export default {
  theme: hopeTheme({
    plugins: {
      icon: {
        // keywords: "iconify", "fontawesome", "fontawesome-with-brands"
        assets: "fontawesome",

        // an url you like
        // for example, these websites allows you to generate your own assets:
        // - a css assets link in [iconfont.cn](https://www.iconfont.cn/?lang=en-us)
        // - a kit link in [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com)
        assets: "/base/my/font-icon/resource.js",

        // an array of above
        assets: [
          "/base/my/font-icon/resource.js",
          "https://example/my/fonr-icon/resouce.css",
          "fontawesome",
        ],
      },
    },
  }),
};
```

To keep simple, we add built-in keywords `"iconify"`, `"fontawesome"` and `"fontawesome-with-brands"` support for you to get started easily.

::: caution

If you use this plugin for commercial project documentation, iconfont is **strongly NOT recommended** as iconfont itself is a study/share platform for designers and developers.

Every icon is uploaded by users, and you must get authorized from the author for commercial usage. Also, there could be chance where the uploader obeys usage term. And upload icons where its copyright is at 3rd party.

## Adding Icons

### In Markdown

In markdown, you can use `::icon decorators... =size /color key=value complex-key="complex value"...::` to insert custom icons.

- A string starting with `=` will be treated as a size definition.
- A string starting with `/` will be treated as a color definition.
- Any string which itself is a valid html attribute will parsed, standardized and added to the icon element.
- The rest part will be treated as the icon name.

```md
::icon =16 /red:: <!-- <VPIcon class="icon" color="red" size="16px" -->

::icon rotate vertical-align=middle:: <!-- <VPIcon icon="icon rotate" vertical-align="middle" -->
```

::: md-demo Demo

::home /blue::
::b:apple =2rem vertical-align=text-bottom::

:::

## In Components

You can use `<VPIcon />` component to add icon in Vue components.

- `icon` prop accepts the icon settings, i.e. icon name or image link
- `color` prop accepts a css color value, which will be used as the icon color (optional)
- `size` prop accepts a css size value, which will be used as the icon size (optional)

::: md-demo Demo

<VPIcon icon="home" color="red" />
<VPIcon
  icon="//theme-hope-assets.vuejs.press/logo.svg"
  size="4rem"
  verticalAlign="middle"
/>

:::

### In Configuration

You can set icon in multiple options:

- Page: set `icon` in frontmatter

  This icon will be used in breadcrumb, page title, navbar generated item, sidebar generated item, page nav, etc.

- Navbar: set `icon` option in navbar items

- Sidebar: set `icon` option in sidebar items

- HomePage: set `icon` option in feature items

### Available Icons

- Iconify: <https://icon-sets.iconify.design/>
- Iconfont: <https://www.iconfont.cn/?lang=en-us>
- Fontawesome: <https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free>

## Icon Types

### Iconify

For full icon list, see <https://icon-sets.iconify.design/>. To use a icon, copy it's icon name of `iconify-icon` in the selector.

Additionally, iconify support the following props:

- `mode`: `svg` (default) `style` `bg` or `mask` to change the render icon mode
- `inline`: `false` to disable inline icon
- `flip`: `horizontal` or `vertical` to flip the icon
- `rotate`: `90`, `180`, `270` to rotate the icon

If you use 1 icon set mostly, you can set the prefix to the icon set name (E.g.: `mdi:`), Then you can use the icon name without the prefix. Manually declaring a full icon name will override the prefix:

```md
::home:: <!-- mdi:home -->
::svg-spinners:180-ring:: <!-- svg-spinners:180-ring -->
```

### Font Awesome

For free icon list, see <https://fontawesome.com/v6/search?o=r&m=free>. To use a icon, copy it's icon name in the selector.

The `fontawesome` keyword only includes the free solid and regular icons. If you want to use the brand icons, you need to use the `fontawesome-with-brands` keyword.

Solid icons can be used directly. if you want to use regular or brand icons, you need to add the `regular:` or `brands:` prefix to the icon name:

```md
::home:: <!-- fas fa-home (solid is default) -->
::solid:home:: <!-- fas fa-home -->
::regular:heart:: <!-- far fa-heart -->
::brands:apple:: <!-- fab fa-apple -->
```

Besides, a three letter prefix, first letter or full class name are also supported:

```md
::s:home:: <!-- fas fa-home -->
::fas:home:: <!-- fas fa-home -->
::fa-solid:home:: <!-- fa-solid fa-home -->

::b:apple:: <!-- fab fa-apple -->
::fab:apple:: <!-- fab fa-apple -->
::fa-brands:apple:: <!-- fa-brands fa-apple -->

::r:heart:: <!-- far fa-heart -->
::far:heart:: <!-- far fa-heart -->
::fa-regular:heart:: <!-- fa-regular fa-heart -->
```

You can add other classes that fontawesome supports after the icon name and split them with a space, where `fa-` prefix is optional:

```md
<!-- a small size icon -->

::home fa-sm:: <!-- fas fa-home fa-sm -->

<!-- rotate 180deg -->

::home rotate-180:: <!-- fas fa-home fa-rotate-180 -->
```

See <https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/style/styling> for all available classes.

::: tip Fontaweome Kits and Pro features

By default, we use jsdelivr CDN to load V6 version of fontawesome free icons. This should be enough for most open source projects.

Besides, you can purchase at [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com) to use kits.

Fontawesome kits with pro features support pro icons, more icon styles and uploading your own icons.

For details, please follow [fontawesome document](https://docs.fontawesome.com/).
