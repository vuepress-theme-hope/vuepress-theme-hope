## Iconfont

[Iconfont](https://iconfont.cn) is a vector icon management and communication platform created by Alimama MUX.

The designer uploads the icon to the Iconfont platform, and the user can customize the download of icons in a variety of formats. Users can also convert the icon into a font.

### How to use

First, you need to create a new project to set and manage your website’s icons:

1. Log in to Iconfont using GitHub or Weibo.
1. Find "Resources → My Projects" at the top of the website, and click the "New Project" icon in the upper right corner.
1. Set a recognizable project name
1. Fill in `FontClass/Symbol prefix` with `icon-` (you can also fill in according to your preference, but you need to set this value to `themeConfig.iconPrefix` with an extra `iconfont` prefix)
1. Font Family please keep `iconfont`
