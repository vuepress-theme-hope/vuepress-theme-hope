## Link check

The theme will use `@vuepress/plugin-links-check` to check your Markdown links by default.

You can customize this feature through `plugins.linksCheck` in theme options, check [links-check docs][links-check] for more details.

## GFM

If your docs both serve on documentation site and directly on GitHub, we provide `plugins.mdEnhance.gfm` in theme options to align your Markdown behavior with GitHub.

::: note

For full GFM syntax, see [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

We are not 100% supporting it to be honestly, we only supply its syntax including linkify, breaks, footnote, task list, code highlight, image mark, mermaid, mathjax and so on.

Some of the behavior might be different, for example to support Vue syntax, we are not disallowing `<script>` tags. But in most situation, the behavior should be same.

Besides, custom container is enabled by default in `@vuepress/theme-default` and `vuepress-theme-hope`, but not available in GitHub Markdown preview.

## v-pre

Since VuePress2 has removed V1's v-pre container in core, the plugin provides `vPre` option to support it. That is, you can use any Mustache syntax in the container below.

:::: md-demo

::: v-pre

{{ abc }}
