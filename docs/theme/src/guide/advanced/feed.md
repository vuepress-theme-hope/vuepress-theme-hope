## Enable Feed Output

The `vuepress-plugin-feed2` plugin can generate feed files in the following three formats for you:

- Atom 1.0
- JSON 1.1
- RSS 2.0

::: tip

Atom and JSON are provided to improve more feed software adaptation.

Please use RSS if possible.

:::

Please set `plugins.feed.atom`, `plugins.feed.json` or `plugins.feed.rss` to `true` in theme options according to the format you want to generate.

::: tip

Of course you can enable them all. This is not a choose 1 from 3 situation.

:::

Considering that rare people stick to feed now, this plugin provides a minimal configuration to adjust the automatic generation of detailed feed files. Also it allows you to freely define the output content of the feed.

## Channel Settings

You can customize the feed channel information by setting the `plugins.feed.channel` in theme options.

We recommend the following settings:

- Convert the date of creating the feed to ISOString and write it into `channel.pubDate`
- The update period of the content set in `channel.ttl` (unit: minutes)
- Set copyright information via `channel.copyright`, or fallback to `copyright` in theme options
- Set the channel author via `channel.author`, or fallback to `author` in theme options

::: tip Default channel settings

- The title and description of the channel is the name and description of the site by default

- The link of the channel and the last update time will be automatically generated by the plugin.

For detailed options and their default values, see <ProjectLink name="feed2" path="/config/channel.html">Feed Channel Config</ProjectLink>.
