The theme adds feed support with [`@vuepress/plugin-feed`][feed]. To use it, install `@vuepress/plugin-feed` manually in your project.

::: info

`vuepress-theme-hope` provides `plugins.feed` in theme options to `@vuepress/plugin-feed`.

## Enable Feed Output

The `@vuepress/plugin-feed` plugin can generate feed files in the following three formats for you:

- Atom 1.0
- JSON 1.1
- RSS 2.0

::: tip Please use RSS if possible. Atom and JSON are only provided for best compatibility.

:::

Please set `plugins.feed.atom`, `plugins.feed.json` or `plugins.feed.rss` to `true` in theme options according to the format you want to generate.

::: tip

Of course, you can enable them all. This is not a "choose 1 from 3" situation.

:::

Considering that rare people stick to feed now, this plugin provides a minimal configuration to adjust the automatic generation of detailed feed files. Also, it allows you to freely define the output content of the feed.

## Channel Settings

You can customize the feed channel information by setting the `plugins.feed.channel` in theme options.

We recommend the following settings:

- Convert the date of creating the feed to ISOString and write it into `channel.pubDate`
- The update period of the content set in `channel.ttl` (unit: minutes)
- Set copyright information via `channel.copyright`, or fallback to `copyright` in theme options
- Set the channel author via `channel.author`, or fallback to `author` in theme options

::: tip Default channel settings

- The title and description of the channel is the name and description of the site by default

- The link of the channel and the last update time will be automatically generated by the plugin.

:::

For detailed options and their default values, see [Feed Channel Docs][feed-channel].

## Generation Control

By default, all articles are added to the feed stream.

You can control how feed item is generated in specific article by configuring the `feed` option in frontmatter, check [Feed frontmatter Docs][feed-frontmatter] for details.

You can take full control of feed items generation by configuring the `plugins.feed.getter`, check [Feed Getter Docs][feed-getter] for details.

### I18n Config

The plugin generates separate feeds for each language.

You can provide different settings for different languages via `plugins.feed.locales`.
