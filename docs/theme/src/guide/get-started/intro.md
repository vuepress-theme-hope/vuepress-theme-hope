## Original Intention

VuePress default theme is just a theme to provide basic documentation layout. E.g.: it doesn't inject meta tags and generate Sitemap for SEO optimization. Besides, though VuePress has extended Markdown syntax to a certain extent, it still lacks some commonly used functions, such as text alignment, mark, flowchart, formula, presentation, etc. At the same time, some features provided by the default theme are weak or missing, such as picture preview, code block copy, toc, etc.

`vuepress-theme-hope` and related plugins were born under this situation.

We not only **greatly improve outlook** comparing to default theme, but also **provide a full range of enhancements for VuePress** with theme plugins.

## Design Goals

::: info Powerful and independent features

We extract each feature into a plugin, so that users can use them in other themes or customize their behavior standalone.

:::

::: info Minimum Configuration

All features will try to use a default value if possible, so you can use them under zero or minimum configuration.

This helps a lot to reduce your migration or learning costs while directly enjoy their convenience.

:::

::: info Improved Layout

The theme interface has been completely refactored to provide customizable and beautiful layouts.

:::

::: info Tree-shaking

With the help of Vue3's composition API, the theme fully achieve "Tree-shaking" while remaining powerful.

The theme will only run with features you want, without being slowed down by other features or affecting the bundle size.
