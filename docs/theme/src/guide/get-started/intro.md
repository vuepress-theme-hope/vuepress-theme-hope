## Original intention

The original intention of building this theme was to find that VuePress is just a pure static document generator. For example, it will not inject meta tags for SEO optimization, nor will it generate a Sitemap to help search engines index the content of the document.

Though VuePress has extended Markdown syntax to a certain extent, it still lacks some commonly used functions, such as text alignment, mark, flowchart, formula, presentation, etc. At the same time, some features provided by the default theme are weak or missing, such as picture preview, dark mode, etc.

In this case, the design of `vuepress-theme-hope` was born.

This theme not only **greatly improve outlook** comparing to `@vuepress/theme-default`, but also **dedicates to provide a full range of enhancements for VuePress** with its plugins.

::: warning This project is not only a theme

Although [vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope](https://github.com/vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope) itself marked as a theme repository, it also contains more than a dozen equally complete and powerful plugin. Each plugin is also powerful, can be used with the default theme or third-party themes.

Based on such a dozen plugins, Mr.Hope can confidently say that `vuepress-theme-hope` is "**A powerful theme with tons of features**". It can also be seen as the most versatile and comprehensive theme among all VuePress themes.

## Design Goals

::: info V1 Goal

- Direction: All the functions are to enhance the document **content richness** and **shareable**.

- Powerful and independent functions: The theme provides comprehensive details on functions and decompose them into independent plugins so users can use them in other themes.

- Zero or simple configuration: All functions of this theme are designed to work under zero or simple configuration to reduce your migration or learning costs while directly enjoy their convenience.

:::

Based on the goal V1 achieved, v2 is further carried out:

- Improved outlook: The theme interface is not based on the layout and style of the default theme, but has been completely refactored.

- Decoupling Features: With the help of Vue3’s composition API, the theme fully achieve "Tree-shaking" while remaining powerful.

  The theme will only run which features you need, without being slowed down by other features or affecting the build size.
