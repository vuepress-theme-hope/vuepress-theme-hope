Progressive Web App Surpport

## Plugin description

Turn on PWA support. A pop-up window will be displayed in the lower right corner when an update is obtained.

The default language of the popup will automatically be set to `baseLang` configured in `themeConfig`.

This feature is enabled by default. If you do not need this feature or want to use other pwa plugins, you can set the `themeConfig.pwa` to `false` to disable the plugin.
