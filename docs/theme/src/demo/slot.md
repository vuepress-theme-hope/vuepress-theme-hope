## Title used to trigger TOC

You can customize the theme layout through these slots, and what you can do depends entirely on your imagination, such as:

- Add a Telegram group button to your docs via the `navbarEndBefore` slot
- Add a banner ad to your document or blog via the `contentBefore` slot
- Add a donate button to your docs or blog via `contentAfter` slot
- Add a list of sponsors to your docs or blogs via the `tocBefore` slot
- Add a QR code to your docs or blog via the `tocAfter` slot
