We strongly recommend you to switch to V2 version, as V2 version provides the following improvements.

<!-- more -->

## Overview

V2 is powered by _VuePress2_, using _Vite2_ / _Webpack5_ and _Vue3_.

V2 is a full rewrite including:

- All the components are rewritten with _Composition API in Vue3_
- All the styles are migrated to _Sass_

Also V2 has a better performance:🚀

- DevServer cold start time reduced by **50%**
- Build memory usage reduced by **65%**
- Build time reduced by **30%**
- Output Size reduced by **25%**
- Webpage performance up to **70%**

## Vue3 Changes

Vue 3 uses proxy to provide reactivity and composition api. The proxy-based reactivity is a lot faster than the old-style reactivity based on setter/getter.

Also, composition api is tree-shaking friendly.

## VuePress2 Changes

VuePress v2 is developed with TypeScript, so it provides better TS support now.

VuePress@v2 also decouple bundler with core. VuePress v2 add supports both Webpack and Vite as bundler. Now Vite is the default bundler, while you can still choose use Webpack. You can even use Vite in dev mode to get better development experience, and use Webpack in build mode to get better browser compatibility.

VuePress@v2 is a lot more flexible than VuePress@v1, it removes siteData and siteData.pages, which greatly increase scalability (specially on large sites with lots of pages). It has a higher score on lighthouse comparing with V1 with less loaded time and higher performance.

## VuePress Theme Hope Changes

VuePressThemeHope@v2 is rewritten with composition API and it's style system is migrated from stylus to sass.

By rewriting theme and plugins with composition api, almost feature you disabled can be removed by tree-shaking when bundling, so that you can get a smaller size easily.

Also, we are adding new features to VuePressThemeHope@v2.
