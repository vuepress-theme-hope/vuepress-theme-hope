## Clone and Install Project

Use Git to clone the project to the local, and use `pnpm` to install dependencies.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope.git

pnpm i
```

::: tip

If you have not installed pnpm, please install it using the following command.

```sh
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@7.1.0 --activate
```

## Project File Structure

The project is a monorepo, managed by pnpm.

- `docs`: place the documentation of each plugin and theme, each subdirectory is a project
- `demo`: theme demo project
- `packages`: place the code of each plugin and theme, each subdirectory is a project

## Document Modification

You can find the corresponding project in the docs directory so you can modify the corresponding Markdown directly.

After ensuring that the `pnpm lint` and `pnpm lint:md` commands emit no errors, you can commit to GitHub to open a PR.

::: tip Preview Docs

Since the docs are using local themes and plugins, you need to build the local project through `pnpm build` first.

To start previewing, cd to the right project under `docs` directory, then run `pnpm docs:vite-dev` (using vite) or `pnpm docs:webpack-dev` (using webpack).

:::

## Project Modification

The structure of each project is as follows:

```
.
├── lib → compiled output file
│ │
│ ├── client → client-side compiled code
│ │
│ └── node → Node.js side compiled code
│
└── src → source file
  │
  ├── client → client-side souce code
  │
  ├── node → Node.js side  soucecode
  │
  └── shared → Shared files between node and client
```

Since the client-side uses ES Module (import/export) and the Node.js side uses commonjs (require/exports), the code in the node and client directorys cannot be cross-referenced.

- `client` directory stores the client code, compiled in esm format
- `node` directory stores the Node.js code, compiled in cjs format
- `shared` directory basically stores TypeScript types, and is compiled in cjs format. It can be referenced by the client and node directorys.

For better performance, all plugins are packed and minified using rollup when they are published.

## Project Development

### How to build

- For better performance, all plugins are packed and minified using `rollup` when they are published.
- Use `cpx` package to copy and watch files in other formats from the source file to the output directory.

### Command

1. Build project: `pnpm build`

   It will use rollup to bundle source files and minify them, and output them to `lib` folder.

1. Develop project: `pnpm dev`

   It will use `tsc` and `cpx` to compile ts file and move other files to output folder.

1. Format project: `pnpm lint`

   It will execute the two commands `pnpm lint:eslint` and `pnpm lint:prettier`.

   If you modify Markdown, you also need to run the `pnpm lint:md` command.

::: warning

Please do not mix build and dev commands as they compile in completely different ways.

You may need to execute the `pnpm clean` command to clear previous build results.

:::

## Commit

The project uses `husky` and `lint-staged` to add Git Hooks for verification:

- In `precommit` stage: use `lint-staged` to check the changed code with the corresponding Linter

  This means that you need to ensure that your code is formatted by the project requirements and can pass Linter tests.

- In `commit-msg` stage: use `commitlint` to verify the commit comment.

  This means that you need to ensure that your commit comments comply with Semantic

::: tip

If you cannot pass the above Git Hooks, you will not be able to complete `git commit`.

If you have already contributed something, but cannot make a commit and don’t know how to fix it, you can add the `--no-verify` flag when committing to bypass Git Hooks.
