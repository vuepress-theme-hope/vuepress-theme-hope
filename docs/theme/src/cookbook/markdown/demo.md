## List

### Unordered List

- Create a list by starting a line with `-`
- Make sub-lists by indenting 2 spaces:

  - Marker character change forces new list start:

    - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    - Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit  
      link break

      New paragraph

- It’s easy!

## Link

[Home page using absolute path](/)

[Home page using relative path](../../README.md)

```md
[Home page using absolute path](/)

[Home page using relative path](../../README.md)
```

::: tip

You can also use these in VuePress:

- [Home page-Can route when editing Markdown file](../../README.md)

- [Home page using absolute path 2](/README.md)

- [Visit in HTML](../../index.html)

To be able to jump to each other when editing the Markdown using the editor, you need to use the **relative path**, also you must place `README.md` in **every folder**.

代码:

```md
- [Home page-Can route when editing Markdown file](../../README.md)

- [Home page using absolute path 2](/README.md)

- [Visit in HTML](../../index.html)
```
