## Site Information

You can use `heroText` to set the main title and `tagline` to set the subtitle.

If you have a logo, you can place it in the `public` folder and set it via `heroImage`, if you want to display another logo in night mode, you can use `heroImageDark`. For better A11y, we recommend that you set the description of Logo to `heroAlt`.

## Home button

You can set them via `actions` which is an array where each element is an object with the following keys:

- `text`: button text
