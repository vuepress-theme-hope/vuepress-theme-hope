## New Features

- JSON-LD support

  The plugin now can generate JSON-LD script tags for you, and is providing an option `jsonLd` to let you customize the JSON-LD properties.

- Description generation

  The plugin can generate a description for you automatically via `autoDescription` options

- Canonical link

  You can set canonical link via `canonicalLink` option. It's useful when your docs are deployed in several places.

## Changed Options

- `customMeta` renamed to `customHead`

  Now you can edit all head tags instead of only meta in V1.
