## Usage

::: warning

VuePress is running on both Node.js Side and Browser Side, we called it `node` and `client`.

So you should be aware to import the correct file, as Node.js has built-in modules and has ability to access file system, and browser has global variables like `window` or `navigator`.

:::

- At Node Side, you should import functions from `vuepress-shared/node`.
- At Client Side, you should import functions from `vuepress-shared/client`.
