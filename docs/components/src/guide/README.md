::: info Tree Shakable

This plugin fully supports tree-shaking.

This means you are free to pick any components you like, and remain the rest of the components unbundled.

For example, if you call this plugin with `{ backToTop: true }`, then only `<BackToTop />` component is injected.

- [AddThis](addthis.md) (Global Components)

- [BackToTop](backtotop.md) (Global Components)

- [Badge](badge.md)

- [CodePen](codepen.md)

- [FontIcon](fonticon.md)

- [PDF](pdf.md)
