title: Notice

The plugin provides a global component `Notice` for you to show some notices to your visitors.

You can configure it via `notice` option in plugin options.

## Usage

You should set `notice.locale`, where the key is locale path and the value is the notice configuration.

Notice configuration includes:

- `title`: Notice title, support both text and HTMLString
- `content`: Notice content, support both text and HTMLString
- `actions`: Notice actions

  Should be an array of objects containing:

  - `text`: action text
  - `link`: action link (optional).

    Pathname will be treated as internal route link and handled by router, and absolute links will be treated as external link and being opened in new window.

  - `type`: `"default"` or `"primary"` (optional)

    Default value is `"default"`.

Here is an example:

```ts
import { componentsPlugin } from "vuepress-plugin-components";

export default {
  plugins: [
    componentsPlugin({
      rootComponents: {
        notice: {
          locales: {
            "/": {
              title: "Notice",
              content: "You may want to check official docs",
              actions: [
                {
                  text: "Check it now",
                  link: "https://plugin-components.vuejs.press/components/notice.html",
                  type: "primary",
                },
                { text: "Later" },
              ],
            },
            "/zh/": {
              title: "通知",
              content: "你可能想要查看官方文档",
              actions: [
                {
                  text: "现在查看",
                  link: "https://plugin-components.vuejs.press/zh/components/notice.html",
                  type: "primary",
                },
                { text: "稍后" },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

## Advanced

Also, we provide some advanced option for you to control notice display.

::: info Notice Display Control

By default, the notice will be shown whenever users enter the site, and it will remain closed in this time if users close it.

To prevent notice being shown again in next visit after users close it, you can set `notice.showOnce: true` in plugin options.

Also, notice remembering is based on notice title and notice content, you can set `noticeKey` option to use a key you want, so that you can edit notice without bothering users who already confirm them.

:::

::: info Close logic

By default, there will be a close button on the right of notice, and users can close it by clicking it.

However if you want users to confirm the notice, you can set `notice.confirm: true`, so that users can only close the notice by hitting action buttons.

:::

::: info Fullscreen

If you want to display a fullscreen popup, you can use `notice.fullscreen: true` in plugin options. We recommend you to use this together with `notice.confirm: true`.

The notice will display in the center of screen, and the other places will be covered by a blur mask.
